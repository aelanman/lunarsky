# lunarsky

An extension to `astropy`, providing selenocentric and topocentric reference frames
for the Moon and transformations of star positions from the ICRS system to these
frames. This is to describe the sky as observed from the surface of the Moon.

Non-relativistic transformations are calculated using the SPICE toolkit.
